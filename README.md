Hello everyone. I am Saeme Qamar. I am a data enthusiast who loves analysing and visualising data to gain fascinating insights
on a variety of topics. I have a MSc in Computer Science, which I received in 2023 from The University of Bath. I am currently based
in the United Kingdom.

I strongly believe in the power of data. The more data we collect, analyse and visualise, the better we become at making impactful
decisions and our understanding on different topics improves. Be it in medicine, finance, business, education or the environment.

For my portfolio projects, I use SQL, Microsoft Excel, Python and Microsoft Power BI. This GitHub portfolio contains both data 
analysis and machine learning projects. Have fun at browsing the content and thank you for visiting!
